# Node Registry — Phase 0

This registry defines how nodes are identified
during Phase 0 of NEXUS deployment.

## Identity
- Each node is identified by a cryptographic public key
- No IP-based identity
- No KYC or personal data

## Registration
- Nodes are added via pull request
- Registry is transparent and auditable

## Scope
This registry is a coordination tool,
not a source of authority.
