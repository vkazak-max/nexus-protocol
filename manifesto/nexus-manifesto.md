# NEXUS Manifesto

## Federation instead of control

---

## The Problem

The Internet was built as a decentralized network,
but access to it has become increasingly centralized.

Local networks, community initiatives, and independent operators
often depend on a small number of providers, policies, and points of failure.

This concentration reduces resilience, autonomy, and trust.

---

## The Idea

NEXUS is based on a simple idea:

**Independent networks should be able to cooperate
without giving up control, ownership, or sovereignty.**

Federation is an alternative to centralization.
Compatibility is an alternative to ownership.

---

## What NEXUS Is

NEXUS is:

- an open protocol for federating autonomous networks
- a framework for voluntary coordination
- a way to share infrastructure without aggregation
- a foundation for resilient, cooperative connectivity

NEXUS does not replace local networks.
It connects them.

---

## What NEXUS Is Not

NEXUS is NOT:

- an Internet provider
- a centralized platform
- a mandatory gateway
- a surveillance system
- a speculative financial product

Participation is voluntary.
Exit is always possible.

---

## Principles

NEXUS is guided by the following principles:

- **Autonomy**  
  Every participant controls their own infrastructure.

- **Voluntary Federation**  
  Cooperation is opt-in and reversible.

- **Minimal Centers**  
  Any coordination point must be replaceable.

- **Resilience by Design**  
  Local operation must survive global failure.

- **Transparency**  
  Rules are public, changes are explicit.

---

## Governance

NEXUS does not impose governance.
It provides tools for coordination.

Decision-making is federative, not hierarchical.
Influence derives from contribution, not ownership.

No single entity controls the network.

---

## Economics

NEXUS enables cooperation without forced monetization.

Any economic mechanisms exist to:

- account for shared resources
- balance contributions
- support sustainability

They are not designed for speculation
and carry no promises of profit.

---

## Diversity of Implementations

There is no single way to implement NEXUS.

Different regions, communities, and technologies
may adopt the protocol in different forms.

This diversity is a strength, not a flaw.

---

## The Goal

The goal of NEXUS is not growth for its own sake.

The goal is to make the Internet:

- more resilient
- more autonomous
- more cooperative

One federation at a time.

---

## Invitation

NEXUS is open.

Anyone may:

- read the protocol
- implement it
- discuss it
- improve it

No permission is required.

Compatibility is enough.
