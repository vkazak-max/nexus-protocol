# NEXUS Protocol v0.1

## Federated Network Infrastructure

Status: Acceptance Draft

---

## 0. Purpose

NEXUS Protocol defines a framework for federating autonomous networks,
nodes, and communities into a cooperative infrastructure
without ownership transfer, centralized authority, or mandatory monetization.

NEXUS does not create an Internet provider.
NEXUS creates compatibility.

---

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Sovereignty

All participants retain full control over their infrastructure.
Federation does not imply ownership, control, or dependency.

### 1.2 Voluntary Participation

Participation in NEXUS is voluntary.
No licenses, fees, or mandatory tokens are required to join.

### 1.3 Right to Exit

Any participant may leave the federation at any time
without penalty or loss of assets.

### 1.4 Minimal Center

Any centralized function must be temporary, replaceable,
and designed for decentralization.

---

## 2. Layered Architecture

### Layer 3 – Data Plane

User and service traffic.
Any uplink technology is permitted (fiber, ISP, wireless, satellite).

### Layer 2 – Control Plane

Overlay network for coordination and governance.
Node-to-node encrypted connectivity.
Identity based on cryptographic keys, not IP addresses.

### Layer 1 – Pulse Plane (Optional)

Minimal communication channel for heartbeat and emergency signaling.
Examples include SMS, satellite messaging, or low-bandwidth data links.

No layer is mandatory for the existence of another.

---

## 3. Federation Participants

### 3.1 Node

A technical participant providing connectivity, routing,
uplink access, or services.
Each node has a cryptographic identity.

### 3.2 Local Network

A group of nodes operating under shared local governance.
Represented as a single federated entity.

### 3.3 Federation Hub

A coordination node facilitating discovery, compatibility,
and shared services.
Hubs do not control traffic and may be replaced or replicated.

---

## 4. Economic Model

### 4.1 NEXUS Token

The NEXUS token is a utility instrument used for:

- resource accounting
- inter-node settlements
- governance signaling

The token is not an investment instrument,
not a security, and carries no profit guarantees.

### 4.2 Economic Restrictions

- No mandatory staking
- No forced fees
- No centralized treasury without DAO mandate

---

## 5. Governance

Governance is federative, not hierarchical.

Voting weight may consider:

- contribution
- uptime
- service provided

Token quantity alone must not define control.

---

## 6. Community Integration

Local community networks remain fully autonomous.
Federation does not interfere with internal governance,
infrastructure, or policies.

Integration is reversible and non-exclusive.

---

## 7. Resilience and Failure

Participants must assume partial or total connectivity loss.
Local operation must remain possible without federation access.

Federation design must avoid single points of failure.

---

## 8. Acceptance Clause

A participant accepts NEXUS Protocol by:

1. Publicly declaring support of its principles
2. Implementing minimal compatibility
3. Respecting autonomy and exit rights of others

No registration or permission is required.

---

## 9. Versioning

Version: v0.1  
Status: Acceptance Draft  
Backward compatibility is required.

Protocol changes require federated consensus.
